Hey Steve,

Thanks for replying.

I'll start here and would like to talk on the phone sometime soon. Please note that we are early in the process and progress will not be very rapid.

- I am working on a Product Development Plan of the 3D Email visualization plug-in for Outlook initially
- We have identified as part of the concept developent and evaluation we would need an experience designer, hence I contacted you
- I would like to explore with you your line of work or expertise and see some examples of what you've done with the hope to see something we can collaborate with
- The initial plan is to 'recruit' the complete virtual team, i.e. Product Manager, UI Designer, Experience Designer, Concept Artist, Research Analyst (hopefully) etc.
- We have currently an office but now I'm focusing on getting the best people from around the world to help us build this product
- I am a skilled strategist, project manager with vast technical background
- I'm looking to establish web-based tools to support communication and collaboration with the team through-out the development
- I'm estimating to complete the business case and proven concept by Feb / Mar next year (the latest)
- We have a commited 3D developer that has been working on prototypes for Chaos Dimention for the past 2 years. He will be continuing working on this as he loves it
- I would like to get the team to commit to working on the planned project on a few hours a week (while working in their full-time employment)
- Re: remuneration, I would look to pay on an hourly basis or somehow using agreement on sweat equity or something like that. Up for negotiation.

This is an initial dump of thoughts and process and more documents will follow shortly. A draft Product Dev Plan and Marketing Plan are being worked on at this stage.

If you wish to talk over the phone so I can explain a bit better what we're trying to do and then we can hopefully see if there is mutual interest in working on this project.

Thanks,
Tomer.
