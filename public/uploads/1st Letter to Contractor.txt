Hey Steve, 

I have founded a 3D software development company in Wellington, New Zealand. Our vision is to develop a standard for visualization and interacting with information using what we call the VUI (Visual User Interface). 

I am currently looking to establish a team to support the product development a am looking for professionals to complement our team. 

We are in the very early stage of the product development and are gearing towards developing 2 concepts and evaluating them with a few corporates here in New Zealand. 

It appears you have vast skills in areas we are in need and I would like to discuss with you this opportunity with the hope of collaborating in some way. 

Hope to hear from you soon, 
Thanks, 
Tomer Sagi
